## ‚ö° **CRITICAL FIXES (DO THESE NOW)**

### **1. Fix bcrypt Compatibility Issue** ‚è∞ **2 minutes**

**Problem:** Intermittent login 401 errors due to bcrypt version incompatibility

**Solution:**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment (if not already activated)
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade packages
pip install --upgrade bcrypt==4.1.2
pip install --upgrade passlib==1.7.4

# Update requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Restart backend server
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Expected Result:** Login should work 100% of the time without retries

**Test:**
1. Try logging in 10 times consecutively
2. All attempts should succeed on first try
3. No 401 errors in backend logs
