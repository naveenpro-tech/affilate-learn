Excellent concept 💡 — you’re describing something that mixes **AI image generation** + **affiliate learning gamification** + **wallet/credit system**, like:

> A “Gemini Nano Banana”-style creative AI inside your course platform — but with high-quality, ready-made prompts that let users generate *social media visuals, profile photos, posters, and teasers*, using the credits they earn from referrals or wallet balance.

Let’s break this down clearly — from concept → architecture → model options → implementation path.

---

## 🧠 1. Concept Summary

### **Goal:**

Add an **AI image generation microservice** to your platform that:

* Generates creative images (e.g. profile photos, posters, social posts).
* Uses predefined prompt templates (so users don’t need to type prompts).
* Deducts credits from users’ wallet balance per generation.
* Allows users to **share** these images (for social/marketing).
* Optionally gives affiliate users **extra credits** as rewards.

## ⚙️ 2. Ideal Architecture (Microservice Add-on)

You don’t need to rebuild your existing platform — just **add a new service**.

### 🧩 Components:

| Layer                      | Description                                                       | Example Tech                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**               | Add new route like `/creative-studio` inside your dashboard.      | Next.js (existing frontend)         |
| **Backend (Microservice)** | Handles image generation requests, credit deduction, and storage. | FastAPI (Python)                    |
| **AI Model**               | The image generator that interprets prompts → creates image.      | See model options below             |
| **Storage**                | Store generated images and serve URLs.                            | Cloudinary / Supabase Storage / S3  |
| **Database Connection**    | Connect to your existing users & wallet tables.                   | Use internal API or DB link         |
| **Queue (optional)**       | If you have high load, manage requests via a queue.               | Redis / Celery / Supabase Functions |

**Flow Example:**

```
User clicks “Create Poster” → selects a template → backend sends prompt → AI model → image → saved to Cloud → URL returned → credits deducted → image visible in user gallery.
```

## 🪄 3. Model Choices (Cheap + Good Quality)

You have three main paths depending on **budget**, **control**, and **quality**.

### 🥇 **Option 1: Stability AI (Stable Diffusion XL / SD3)**

* 🧩 Open-source and can run on your own GPU (or cloud GPU).
* 💰 Cheapest in long run (you pay only GPU cost or API credits).
* 🌈 Great quality, customizable (you can fine-tune for “poster” or “profile” style).
* ⚙️ API: [https://platform.stability.ai](https://platform.stability.ai)
* 🧠 Best if: you want full control + host your own microservice.

### 🥈 **Option 2: Replicate / HuggingFace API**

* 🧩 Ready-to-use image models (Stable Diffusion, Flux, SDXL Turbo, etc.).
* 💰 Pay-per-use ($0.002–$0.01 per image).
* 🚀 No GPU setup required.
* ⚙️ Replicate: [https://replicate.com](https://replicate.com)
* 🧠 Best if: you want fastest MVP and easy scaling.

### 🥉 **Option 3: OpenAI (DALL·E 3)**

* ✨ Excellent output (poster-level creativity).
* 💰 Slightly higher cost per image.
* 🧠 Best if: you want guaranteed quality and easy integration.
* ⚙️ API: `openai.images.generate(...)`

> 💡 You can **start with Replicate API** (low-code), and **later migrate to Stable Diffusion** running in your own FastAPI microservice when usage grows.

## 🧩 4. Credit System Integration

You already have a **wallet system** in your app → perfect!

So you can:

1. Add a new column: `wallet.credits`
2. Each image generation = deduct X credits
3. If wallet balance < cost → show “Recharge with wallet” modal
4. Allow conversion: 1 INR (or $1) = 10 credits (example)

Example (FastAPI backend snippet):

```python
@app.post("/api/generate-image")
def generate_image(user_id: int, template_id: str):
    user = db.get_user(user_id)
    cost = 10  # credits per generation
    if user.wallet.credits < cost:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Not enough credits")
    prompt = get_template_prompt(template_id)
    image_url = generate_image_with_api(prompt)
    db.save_image(user_id, image_url)
    db.update_wallet(user_id, -cost)
    return {"image_url": image_url}
```

## 🌍 5. Deployment Path (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: MVP (No-code + API)

* Use Replicate API or OpenAI DALL·E.
* Add simple FastAPI endpoint `/api/generate-image`.
* Store output in Cloudinary.
* Deduct credits from wallet.
* Done — integrated inside your existing `/dashboard`.

### Phase 2: Self-hosted Microservice

* Run Stable Diffusion model in Docker (GPU required).
* Connect via internal API to your FastAPI backend.
* Can scale with Kubernetes or ECS (later).

### Phase 3: Monetization

* Add “Credit Packs” in your `/wallet` page.
* Allow users to redeem wallet balance for credits.
* Offer “Affiliate Bonus Credits” for sharing their generated images.

## 🧭 8. Migration-Ready Setup

Once you want to migrate:

* Export prompts/templates to DB table (`image_templates`).
* Switch AI provider in `model.py` (keep the same function interface).
* Update `.env` with new API key.
* Reuse the same FastAPI route `/api/generate-image` — no frontend changes.

* 🧰 Create a **technical blueprint (diagram + file structure)** for this microservice?
* or 🎨 a **mock UI design concept** for the “Creative Studio” dashboard page (with credits, templates, generate button)?
