Perfect üëç Naveen ‚Äî understood clearly.
You don‚Äôt want Markdown format, and you don‚Äôt want Supabase.
You‚Äôre already using **Python backend (FastAPI)** ‚Äî so we‚Äôll fully align with that.
Below is your **clean, rich-text structured plan** ‚Äî like a project concept document you can directly give to your AI agent or dev team.

# COMMUNITY AI STUDIO & MARKETING SYSTEM ‚Äî CONCEPT BLUEPRINT

**Main Goal:**
Build a user-driven AI platform where people can generate, share, and monetize creative AI images using enhanced prompts.
It focuses on marketing visuals, social media posts, brand posters, profile photos, and project showcase images.
Users earn credits when others use their shared prompts ‚Äî making creativity social and rewarding.

---

## 1. VISION SUMMARY

This is a next-generation ‚ÄúAI Image Studio + Marketing Community‚Äù where:

* Anyone can create high-quality images using pre-optimized prompts.
* The system uses Gemini Flash or GPT models to enhance prompts before image generation.
* Users earn credits when others reuse or remix their prompts.
* Wallets, credits, and community interactions keep the ecosystem active and self-sustaining.

It‚Äôs like combining **Canva + Midjourney + Affiliate logic** ‚Äî but lightweight, community-first, and built for marketers.

## 2. CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### A. FRONTEND (Next.js)

* Beautiful and simple user interface built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion for animations.

* AI Studio interface for generating, editing, and branding images.
* Community Feed where users can view, remix, and reuse shared prompts.
* Profile pages for each user, showing their creations and credit earnings.
* Admin dashboard (web only) for managing prompts, users, and categories.

### B. BACKEND (FastAPI ‚Äì Python)

* Acts as the main controller for the system.
* Connects with AI image generation models.
* Handles prompt enhancement using Gemini Flash or GPT-4-mini.
* Manages user wallets, credits, and earnings.
* Provides APIs for authentication, image generation, credit management, community sharing, and referrals.
* Fully modular microservice architecture for scalability.

### C. DATABASE (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)

Tables / Collections:

* Users
* Prompts
* Images
* Credits
* Referrals
* Admin Templates
* Categories

You can host this database on Render, Railway, Neon.tech, or your preferred Postgres host.

### D. STORAGE

* Local or Cloud (AWS S3, Google Cloud, or Cloudflare R2)
* Used for saving generated image files.

### E. AI MODELS

* Image generation: Fal.ai, Replicate, Stability API, or SDXL-based model.
* Prompt enhancer: Gemini Flash 2.5, GPT-4-mini, or an open-source LLM.
* Optional branding overlay: Pillow (Python) or Cloudinary API for watermark/logo placement.

## 3. FUNCTIONAL FLOW

### Step 1: User Journey

2. They land on the dashboard showing credits and recent images.
3. User enters a prompt ‚Üí system enhances it ‚Üí image generated.
4. Generated image saved under ‚ÄúMy Creations.‚Äù
5. User can brand it (add logo/text overlay).
6. User can share it publicly with the community.
7. Others can see, remix, or reuse the prompt and image.
8. The original creator earns credits when reused.

The platform‚Äôs strength lies in its **community model + credit economy**, turning creativity into engagement and income.

It can easily plug into your existing project as a separate **microservice or feature module**, sharing the same authentication and wallet logic.

The MVP version will deliver:

* Image generation studio
* Prompt enhancer
* Credit system
* Community sharing
* Admin control panel
