## üîß Issue #1: Invoice Download Feature (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### Problem
Invoice download buttons were not visible on the purchase history page, preventing users from downloading their GST-compliant invoices.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Double Prefix Issue:** Invoice router had `prefix="/invoices"` and was registered with `prefix="/api/invoices"` in main.py, creating `/api/invoices/invoices/*` endpoints (404 errors)
2. **Missing Auto-Generation:** Invoices were not automatically generated on payment success - only manual generation via API endpoint was possible
3. **No Existing Invoices:** All 14 successful payments in database had no associated invoice records

### Solutions Applied

**1. Fixed Double Prefix Issue**
- **File:** `backend/app/api/invoices.py`
- **Change:** Removed `prefix="/invoices"` from router definition (line 16)
- **Result:** Endpoints now accessible at `/api/invoices/*` instead of `/api/invoices/invoices/*`

**2. Added Auto-Invoice Generation**
- **File:** `backend/app/api/payments.py`
- **Change:** Added invoice auto-generation to payment verification endpoint (lines 222-228)
- **Code:**
```python
# Auto-generate invoice for the payment
try:
    from app.services.invoice_service import InvoiceService
    invoice_service = InvoiceService(db)
    invoice = invoice_service.create_invoice(payment.id)
    print(f"[PAYMENT VERIFY] Invoice generated: {invoice.invoice_number}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error generating invoice: {e}")
    # Don't fail the payment if invoice generation fails
```

**3. Generated Invoices for Existing Payments**
- Created invoices for all 14 existing successful payments
- Invoice numbers: INV-2025-00001 through INV-2025-00014
- All invoices include GST breakdown (18% GST)

### Testing Results

‚úÖ **Backend Endpoints:**
- `/api/invoices/generate/{payment_id}` - Working (no double prefix)
- `/api/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Working
- `/api/invoices/{invoice_id}/download` - Working
- `/api/invoices/` - Working
- `/api/invoices/payment/{payment_id}` - Working

‚úÖ **Frontend Features:**
- Invoice download buttons visible on purchase cards
- Invoice numbers displayed (e.g., INV-2025-00007 for Platinum)
- PDF download working with success toast message
- Invoice contains accurate data (user details, purchase details, GST breakdown)

‚úÖ **Future Payments:**
- All future payments will auto-generate invoices on verification

### Commit
```
fix: Remove double prefix from invoice API and auto-generate invoices on payment success
```

## üîß Issue #2: Individual Course Purchase Feature (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### Problem
Need to verify that locked courses show "Purchase" buttons for users who don't have the required package tier, enabling individual course purchases.

### Investigation

**Test Setup:**
- Created test user: `silveruser@test.com` (password: `test123`)
- Assigned Silver package to test user
- Logged in as Silver user to test locked course access

**Backend Features Found (Already Implemented):**
- Individual course purchase API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/course-purchases/initiate` - Create Razorpay order for course
  - `POST /api/course-purchases/verify` - Verify payment and grant access
  - `GET /api/course-purchases/my-purchases` - Get purchased courses
  - `GET /api/course-purchases/check-access/{course_id}` - Check course access
- `UserCoursePurchase` model for tracking individual purchases
- Razorpay payment integration for course purchases
- Invoice auto-generation for course purchases

**Frontend Features Found (Already Implemented):**
- Individual course purchase page: `/courses/[id]/purchase`
- `coursePurchasesAPI` wrapper for API calls
- Payment flow with Razorpay integration
- Success/failure handling

### Root Cause
The Browse Courses page was redirecting to `/packages` instead of `/courses/{id}/purchase` when clicking "Unlock Course" button.

### Solution Applied

**File:** `frontend/app/courses/browse/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
1. Changed button text from "Unlock Course" to "Purchase Course"
2. Changed redirect URL from `/packages` to `/courses/${course.id}/purchase`

**Before (Line 303):**
```typescript
router.push('/packages');
```

**After (Line 303):**
```typescript
router.push(`/courses/${course.id}/purchase`);
```

### Testing Results

‚úÖ **Browse Courses Page (Silver User):**
- Silver tier courses show "Start Learning" button (unlocked)
- Gold tier courses show "Purchase Course" button (locked)
- Platinum tier courses show "Purchase Course" button (locked)

‚úÖ **Individual Course Purchase Page:**
- Clicking "Purchase Course" redirects to `/courses/{id}/purchase`
- Purchase page shows course details (title, description, lessons, package tier)
- Purchase page shows price (‚Çπ199 for individual courses)
- Purchase page shows "Purchase Now" button
- Purchase page shows benefits (lifetime access, certificate, etc.)

‚úÖ **Individual Course Purchase Flow:**
- Complete flow is functional (initiate ‚Üí payment ‚Üí verify ‚Üí access granted)
- Invoices auto-generate for course purchases
- Purchased courses appear in "My Courses" page

### Commit
```
fix: Enable individual course purchase feature in Browse Courses page
```

### Status: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

## üîß Issue #3: Bank Details Optional Field Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Problem
PAN Number and GST Number fields are labeled as "Optional" in the UI, but the form validation may be treating them as required fields or validating them even when empty.

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario A: Empty Optional Fields (Should PASS)**
- Left PAN Number empty
- Left GST Number empty
- Filled all required fields with valid data
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Form submitted successfully without errors

**Scenario B: Valid Optional Fields (Should PASS)**
- Entered valid PAN: `ABCDE1234F`
- Entered valid GST: `29ABCDE1234F1Z5`
- Filled all required fields with valid data
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Form submitted successfully

**Scenario C: Invalid PAN Format (Should FAIL with error)**
- Entered invalid PAN: `INVALID123`
- Left GST empty
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Inline error message shown: "Invalid PAN format (e.g., ABCDE1234F)"
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Toast notification: "Please fix the validation errors"
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Form submission blocked

**Scenario D: Invalid GST Format (Should FAIL with error)**
- Left PAN empty
- Entered invalid GST: `INVALIDGST`
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Inline error message shown: "Invalid GST format (e.g., 22AAAAA0000A1Z5)"
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Toast notification: "Please fix the validation errors"
- **Result:** ‚úÖ Form submission blocked

### Additional Issue Found
Console warning: `value prop on input should not be null`

### Solution Applied

**File:** `frontend/app/profile/bank-details/page.tsx`
**Change:** Modified `loadBankDetails` function to convert null values to empty strings

**Code Added (Lines 38-50):**
```typescript
// Convert null values to empty strings to avoid React warnings
const cleanedData = {
  account_holder_name: response.data.account_holder_name || '',
  bank_name: response.data.bank_name || '',
  account_number: response.data.account_number || '',
  ifsc_code: response.data.ifsc_code || '',
  branch_name: response.data.branch_name || '',
  account_type: response.data.account_type || 'Savings',
  upi_id: response.data.upi_id || '',
  pan_number: response.data.pan_number || '',
  gst_number: response.data.gst_number || '',
};
setFormData(cleanedData);
```

### Testing Results

‚úÖ **Validation Behavior:**
- PAN Number (Optional): Only validates format if value is entered
- GST Number (Optional): Only validates format if value is entered
- UPI ID (Optional): Only validates format if value is entered
- Branch Name (Optional): No validation, accepts any text
- Required fields: Account Holder Name, Bank Name, Account Number, IFSC Code, Account Type

‚úÖ **Console:**
- No null value warnings
- No validation errors for empty optional fields

### Commit
```
fix: Convert null values to empty strings in bank details form
```

### Status: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
