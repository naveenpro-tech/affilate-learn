## ✅ **FIX #1: Individual Course Purchase Access** (CRITICAL)

### **Issue:**
Users who purchased individual courses could not access them. Payment succeeded, money was deducted, but course remained locked.

### **Root Cause:**
The `check_user_access()` function in `backend/app/api/courses.py` only checked package-based access, not individual course purchases.

### **Fix Applied:**
Updated `check_user_access()` to check both:
1. Individual course purchases (UserCoursePurchase table)
2. Package-based access (UserPackage table)

**File:** `backend/app/api/courses.py`
```python
def check_user_access(user: User, course: Course, db: Session) -> bool:
    """Check if user has access to a course based on their package OR individual purchase"""
    if user.is_admin:
        return True

    # Check individual course purchase first
    from app.models.user_course_purchase import UserCoursePurchase
    individual_purchase = db.query(UserCoursePurchase).filter(
        UserCoursePurchase.user_id == user.id,
        UserCoursePurchase.course_id == course.id,
        UserCoursePurchase.is_active == True
    ).first()
    
    if individual_purchase:
        return True

    # Check package-based access (existing logic)
    ...
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Impact:** Users can now access courses they purchased individually

---

## ✅ **FIX #2: Package Purchase Conflict Resolution** (CRITICAL)

### **Issue:**
When a user purchases an individual course for ₹199, then later buys a Gold package that includes that same course, there was no conflict handling.

### **User Requirements:**
- Do NOT refund the ₹199 individual course purchase
- User should get full Gold package access (including the course they already bought)
- No duplicate charges
- Clear communication to user about what happened

### **Fix Applied:**
Added conflict detection logic in package purchase verification:

**File:** `backend/app/api/payments.py`
```python
# Check for existing individual course purchases
package_courses = db.query(Course).filter(Course.package_id == payment.package_id).all()

existing_individual_purchases = []
for course in package_courses:
    individual_purchase = db.query(UserCoursePurchase).filter(
        UserCoursePurchase.user_id == current_user.id,
        UserCoursePurchase.course_id == course.id,
        UserCoursePurchase.is_active == True
    ).first()
    if individual_purchase:
        existing_individual_purchases.append({
            'course_title': course.title,
            'amount_paid': individual_purchase.amount_paid
        })

# Log conflicts for admin review
if existing_individual_purchases:
    print(f"User {current_user.email} purchased package but already owns individual courses:")
    for purchase in existing_individual_purchases:
        print(f"  - {purchase['course_title']} (₹{purchase['amount_paid']})")
```

**Email Notification:**
Updated purchase confirmation email to notify user about existing individual purchases:

**File:** `backend/app/utils/email.py`
```python
additional_note = ""
if existing_individual_purchases:
    additional_note = "\n\nNote: You previously purchased the following courses individually:\n"
    for purchase in existing_individual_purchases:
        additional_note += f"- {purchase['course_title']} (₹{purchase['amount_paid']})\n"
    additional_note += "\nYou now have full package access to all courses. Your individual purchases remain in your transaction history."
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Impact:** 
- No financial loss for users
- Clear communication about existing purchases
- Admin can review conflicts via logs
- Individual purchases kept for audit trail

---

## ✅ **FIX #3: Course Purchase Payment Error** (CRITICAL)

### **Issue:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: null value in column "package_id" 
of relation "payments" violates not-null constraint
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `Payment` model required `package_id` (NOT NULL), but individual course purchases don't have a package.

### **Fix Applied:**
1. Made `package_id` nullable in Payment model
2. Created database migration

**File:** `backend/app/models/payment.py`
```python
# BEFORE:
package_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("packages.id"), nullable=False)

# AFTER:
package_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("packages.id"), nullable=True)
```

**Migration:** `backend/alembic/versions/005_make_payment_package_id_nullable.py`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Impact:** Individual course purchases now work without database errors

---

## ✅ **FIX #4: Email Verification Not Sending** (HIGH PRIORITY)

### **Issue:**
- Welcome emails were working ✅
- Course purchase emails were working ✅
- Verification emails were NOT being sent ❌

### **Root Cause:**
Verification emails were only sent when user manually requested them via `/api/email-verification/send-verification`. They were NOT sent automatically during registration.

### **Fix Applied:**
Updated registration endpoint to automatically send verification email:

**File:** `backend/app/api/auth.py`
```python
# Generate verification token for email verification
import secrets
from datetime import timedelta
verification_token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
verification_expires = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=24)
new_user.verification_token = verification_token
new_user.verification_token_expires = verification_expires
new_user.email_verified = False
db.commit()

# Send verification email (non-blocking)
try:
    from app.services.email_service import send_verification_email
    import asyncio
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(send_verification_email(
        email=new_user.email,
        name=new_user.full_name,
        token=verification_token
    ))
    loop.close()
    logger.info(f"Verification email sent to {new_user.email}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to send verification email: {str(e)}")
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Impact:** 
- New users receive verification email immediately after registration
- Existing users can request resend via `/api/email-verification/resend`

---

## ✅ **FIX #5: Certificate Generation Button Missing** (HIGH PRIORITY)

### **Issue:**
Certificate generation feature existed but the button was only on `/courses/[id]/modules` page, not on the main course learning page.

### **Fix Applied:**
Added "Generate Certificate" button to course learning page header:

**File:** `frontend/app/courses/[id]/learn/page.tsx`
```typescript
const handleGenerateCertificate = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await coursesAPI.issueCertificate(parseInt(courseId));
    toast.success('Certificate generated successfully!');
    router.push(`/certificates/${response.data.certificate_number}`);
  } catch (error: any) {
    const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to generate certificate';
    toast.error(errorMessage);
  }
};

// In JSX:
{courseProgress && courseProgress.progress_percentage === 100 && (
  <button
    onClick={handleGenerateCertificate}
    className="px-6 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-500 to-orange-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:from-yellow-600 hover:to-orange-600 transition-all shadow-lg flex items-center gap-2 font-semibold"
  >
    🏆 Generate Certificate
  </button>
)}
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Impact:** 
- Button appears when course is 100% complete
- Beautiful gradient styling with trophy emoji
- Redirects to certificate page after generation
