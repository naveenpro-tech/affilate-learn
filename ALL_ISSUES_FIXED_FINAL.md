## 🎉 ALL 6 ISSUES RESOLVED

### ✅ Issue 1: React Toaster Error - FIXED
**Problem:** "Objects are not valid as a React child" error  
**Solution:** Added type checking in error handlers to convert objects to strings  
**File:** `frontend/app/packages/page.tsx`

### ✅ Issue 2: Referral System Not Working - FIXED
**Problem:** Referred users not appearing until they purchased  
**Solution:** Modified API to query `users` table based on `referred_by_id`  
**File:** `backend/app/api/referrals.py`  
**Result:** Referrals show IMMEDIATELY after registration

### ✅ Issue 3: Package Not Showing in Dashboard - FIXED
**Problem:** Dashboard showed "None" after purchase  
**Solution:** Added user data refresh after payment + fixed API field name mismatch  
**Files:** `frontend/app/packages/page.tsx`  
**Result:** Package displays immediately after purchase

### ✅ Issue 4: Referral Stats Not Updating - FIXED
**Problem:** Dashboard showed "Total Referrals: 0"  
**Solution:** Modified stats endpoint to count all referred users  
**File:** `backend/app/api/referrals.py`  
**Result:** Accurate referral counts

### ✅ Issue 5: Demo Courses - CREATED
**Status:** ✅ 15 courses successfully seeded  
**Distribution:**
- Silver: 5 courses
- Gold: 5 additional courses (10 total)
- Platinum: 5 additional courses (15 total)

### ✅ Issue 6: Payment Verification 422 Error - FIXED
**Problem:** API field name mismatch (`order_id` vs `razorpay_order_id`)

**File:** `frontend/app/packages/page.tsx`  
**Result:** Payment verification now works correctly

## 🔍 Database Verification

After testing, verify database records:

```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Check user packages
python -c "from app.core.database import SessionLocal; from app.models.user_package import UserPackage; from app.models.user import User; from app.models.package import Package; db = SessionLocal(); packages = db.query(UserPackage).all(); print(f'Total: {len(packages)}'); [print(f'{db.query(User).filter(User.id == p.user_id).first().email}: {db.query(Package).filter(Package.id == p.package_id).first().name}') for p in packages]; db.close()"

# Check referrals
python -c "from app.core.database import SessionLocal; from app.models.referral import Referral; from app.models.user import User; db = SessionLocal(); referrals = db.query(Referral).all(); print(f'Total: {len(referrals)}'); [print(f'{db.query(User).filter(User.id == r.referrer_id).first().email} → {db.query(User).filter(User.id == r.referee_id).first().email}') for r in referrals]; db.close()"

# Check commissions
python -c "from app.core.database import SessionLocal; from app.models.commission import Commission; from app.models.user import User; db = SessionLocal(); commissions = db.query(Commission).all(); print(f'Total: {len(commissions)}'); [print(f'{db.query(User).filter(User.id == c.user_id).first().email}: ₹{c.amount} ({c.status})') for c in commissions]; db.close()"

# Check courses
python -c "from app.core.database import SessionLocal; from app.models.course import Course; db = SessionLocal(); print(f'Total courses: {db.query(Course).count()}'); db.close()"
```
