# üí∞ WALLET & PAYOUT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED - WALLET AS SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**

---

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

This document explains the corrected architecture for the Wallet and Payout system, which now uses **Wallet as the single source of truth** for all commission earnings and payouts.

---

## üéØ **CORE PRINCIPLE**

**Wallet Balance = Single Source of Truth**

All money flows through the wallet:
1. Commissions earned ‚Üí Auto-credited to Wallet
2. Payout requested ‚Üí Debited from Wallet
3. Admin approves ‚Üí Payout processed
4. Bank transfer ‚Üí Payout completed

---

## üîÑ **COMPLETE FLOW**

### **Step 1: Commission Earned**
```
User A refers User B
    ‚Üì
User B purchases package
    ‚Üì
Commission calculated (40% Level 1 or 10% Level 2)
    ‚Üì
TWO things happen:
    1. Commission record created (for audit/history)
    2. Wallet auto-credited (money added to balance)
```

**Backend Code:**
```python
# In referral_service.py
# 1. Create commission record
commission = Commission(
    user_id=referrer.id,
    amount=commission_amount,
    status="pending"  # For history/audit only
)

# 2. Auto-credit wallet (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
credit_wallet_internal(
    db=db,
    user_id=referrer.id,
    amount=commission_amount,
    source=TransactionSource.COMMISSION,
    description=f"Level 1 commission from {referee.full_name}'s package"
)
```

### **Step 2: User Requests Payout**
```
User navigates to Payout page
    ‚Üì
Sees Wallet Balance (e.g., ‚Çπ11,400)
    ‚Üì
Clicks "Request Payout"
    ‚Üì
Backend checks:
    - Wallet balance >= ‚Çπ500 (minimum)
    - Bank details exist
    - No pending payout already
    ‚Üì
Wallet debited immediately
    ‚Üì
Payout record created (status: pending)
    ‚Üì
Wallet transaction created (audit trail)
```

**Backend Code:**
```python
# In payouts.py - request_payout()
wallet = get_or_create_wallet(db, current_user.id)

# Check balance
if wallet.balance < settings.MINIMUM_PAYOUT_AMOUNT:
    raise HTTPException(...)

# Create payout
payout = Payout(
    user_id=current_user.id,
    amount=wallet.balance,  # Full wallet balance
    status='pending'
)

# Debit wallet immediately
create_transaction(
    db=db,
    wallet=wallet,
    transaction_type=TransactionType.DEBIT,
    source=TransactionSource.PAYOUT,
    amount=wallet.balance,
    description=f"Payout request #{payout.id}"
)
```

### **Step 3: Admin Approves Payout**
```
Admin views pending payouts
    ‚Üì
Approves payout
    ‚Üì
Payout status: pending ‚Üí processing
    ‚Üì
Admin initiates bank transfer
```

### **Step 4: Payout Completed**
```
Bank transfer successful
    ‚Üì
Admin marks payout as completed
    ‚Üì
Payout status: processing ‚Üí completed
    ‚Üì
Money transferred to user's bank account
```

## üìä **DATABASE MODELS**

### **Wallet Model**
```python
class Wallet(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), unique=True)
    balance = Column(Float, default=0.0)           # Current balance
    total_earned = Column(Float, default=0.0)      # All-time earnings
    total_withdrawn = Column(Float, default=0.0)   # All-time withdrawals
    total_spent = Column(Float, default=0.0)       # Purchases (future)
```

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for user's money

### **WalletTransaction Model**
```python
class WalletTransaction(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    wallet_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("wallets.id"))
    type = Column(Enum(TransactionType))      # CREDIT or DEBIT
    source = Column(Enum(TransactionSource))  # COMMISSION, PAYOUT, etc.
    amount = Column(Float)
    balance_before = Column(Float)
    balance_after = Column(Float)
    description = Column(Text)
    reference_id = Column(String)  # Links to commission_id, payout_id
```

**Purpose:** Complete audit trail of all wallet transactions

### **Commission Model**
```python
class Commission(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    referral_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("referrals.id"))
    amount = Column(Float)
    commission_type = Column(String)  # level1, level2
    status = Column(String)  # pending (for history only)
    payout_id = Column(Integer, nullable=True)  # Not used anymore
```

**Purpose:** History and audit log of which referrals generated which commissions

### **Payout Model**
```python
class Payout(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    amount = Column(Float)
    status = Column(String)  # pending, processing, completed, failed
    bank_account_number = Column(String)
    bank_ifsc = Column(String)
    upi_id = Column(String)
```

**Purpose:** Track payout requests and their status

## üí° **KEY CHANGES FROM OLD ARCHITECTURE**

### **OLD (Problematic):**
```
Commission Earned
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Commission Table (status: pending)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Payout reads from here ‚ùå
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Wallet (auto-credit)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Ignored by payout ‚ùå

Result: Money counted twice!
```

### **NEW (Correct):**
```
Commission Earned
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Commission Table (history/audit only)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Wallet (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH) ‚úÖ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Payout reads from here ‚úÖ

Result: One balance, clear flow!
```

## üìù **MIGRATION NOTES**

**No database migration needed!**

The Wallet and Commission tables already exist. We're just changing the logic:
- Commissions continue to be created (for history)
- Commissions continue to auto-credit wallet (already implemented)
- Payouts now read from wallet instead of commissions

**Existing data:**
- Users with existing commissions: Already in wallet
- Users with pending payouts: Will complete normally
- No data loss or corruption

2. **Referral Bonuses**

   - Special promotions, contests

3. **Partial Payouts**
   - Allow users to withdraw partial amounts
   - Keep some balance in wallet

4. **Wallet Top-Up**
   - Users can add money to wallet
   - Use for purchases, courses

5. **Wallet-to-Wallet Transfer**
   - Send money to other users
