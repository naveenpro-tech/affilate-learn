  - Admin templates and categories
  - Moderation and reporting
  - Analytics metrics

### API Routes
- [x] Created `backend/app/api/studio.py` with core endpoints:
  - `POST /api/studio/enhance-prompt` - Enhance prompts with AI
  - `POST /api/studio/generate` - Generate images with credit debit
  - `GET /api/studio/generate/{job_id}` - Check generation status
  - `GET /api/studio/my-creations` - List user's generated images
  - `DELETE /api/studio/my-creations/{image_id}` - Delete image
  - `GET /api/studio/credits/balance` - Get credit balance

### Integration
- [x] Registered studio router in `backend/app/main.py`
- [x] Backend server running successfully on http://localhost:8000
- [x] All endpoints accessible via FastAPI docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Monolithic with Clear Module Boundaries
```

├── app/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── studio.py (9 new models)
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── image_generation_service.py (provider adapters)
│   │   ├── prompt_enhancement_service.py (LLM adapters)
│   │   └── credit_ledger_service.py (credit management)

│   └── core/
│       └── config.py (updated with studio settings)
```

### Provider Adapters (Future-Proof)
- **Image Generation**: Replicate (active) → Stability AI, Fal.ai, OpenAI (ready)
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Gemini (active) → OpenAI, Claude, Local LLM (ready)
- **Storage**: Cloudinary (configured)

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### Credit Economy
- Idempotent credit transactions (prevents double-charging)
- Tier-based costs: Standard (1), Premium2 (2), Premium4 (4)
- Credit balance tracking with full ledger history
- Automatic refunds on generation failure

### Image Generation
- Async-ready architecture (currently synchronous with Replicate)
- Tier-based parameters (resolution, steps, guidance scale)
- Prompt enhancement before generation
- Error handling and logging

### Prompt Enhancement
- AI-powered prompt improvement using Gemini Flash 2.5
- Adds visual details, art style, lighting, mood
- Fallback to original prompt on error
- Structured engineering for better results

### Database Design
- Proper relationships and foreign keys
- Unique constraints (one like per user per post, etc.)
- Indexes for performance
- Audit trail via credit_ledger and referral_events

   - Create Creative Studio page with prompt input
   - Implement tier selection UI
   - Build My Creations gallery
   - Add credit purchase flow

2. **Testing** (P1.QA tasks)
   - Write unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for user flows

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with studio features
   - Create admin runbook
   - Document API endpoints
