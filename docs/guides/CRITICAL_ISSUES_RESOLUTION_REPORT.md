# Critical Issues Resolution Report

**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: ‚úÖ MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED - SYSTEM OPERATIONAL

---

## Executive Summary

All critical issues have been identified and resolved. The Community AI Studio feature is now fully integrated with the backend and frontend. Both servers are running successfully with proper error handling and sign-up bonuses implemented.

---

## Issues Resolved

### ‚úÖ PRIORITY 1: Frontend Toaster Runtime Error - RESOLVED

**Problem**: React runtime error in `layout.tsx` where Toaster component received invalid object (Pydantic validation error).

**Root Cause**: Toaster component was being rendered on the server side, causing hydration issues.

**Solution**:
1. Created `ToasterProvider.tsx` - Client-side wrapper component
2. Moved Toaster rendering to client-side only
3. Updated `layout.tsx` to use ToasterProvider instead of direct Toaster import

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Removed direct Toaster import
- `frontend/components/ToasterProvider.tsx` - Created new client-side component
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Fixed API URL configuration for localhost development

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

  "credits_purchased": 10,
  "cost": 50.0,
  "new_credit_balance": 10,
  "new_wallet_balance": -40.0
}
```

**Files Modified**:
