---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### **1. Login Issue - FIXED** ✅

**Problem:** Login endpoint returning 500 Internal Server Error due to SQLAlchemy relationship configuration errors.

**Root Causes:**
1. User.notifications relationship - Ambiguous foreign keys (user_id and from_user_id)
2. CommunityPost.comments relationship - Missing relationship definition

**Solutions:**
1. Fixed `backend/app/models/user.py` - Added foreign_keys parameter
2. Fixed `backend/app/models/studio.py` - Added comments relationship

**Verification:** ✅ Login endpoint now returns JWT token successfully
