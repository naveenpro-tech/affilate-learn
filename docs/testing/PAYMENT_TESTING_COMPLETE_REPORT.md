# Payment Testing & Issue Report - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED & DOCUMENTED  
**Severity**: HIGH (Blocks payment flow)

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing of the payment flow revealed a critical issue: **Razorpay authentication is failing** due to invalid or outdated test keys. The root cause has been identified and documented with two solution options.

---

## What Was Tested

### ✅ Completed Tests

1. **Registration Flow** - ✅ WORKING
   - User registration successful
   - JWT token generated
   - User created in database

2. **Login Flow** - ✅ WORKING
   - Admin login successful
   - User login successful
   - JWT tokens valid

3. **Package Listing** - ✅ WORKING
   - Packages retrieved from API
   - All 3 packages visible (Silver, Gold, Platinum)

4. **Payment Order Creation** - ❌ FAILED
   - Error: "Authentication failed"
   - Root cause: Invalid Razorpay test keys

---

## Issue Details

### Error Information
```
HTTP Status: 500 Internal Server Error
Error Message: "Failed to create payment order: Authentication failed"
Error Type: razorpay.errors.BadRequestError
Location: backend/app/services/razorpay_service.py:41
```

### Backend Logs
```
[RAZORPAY] Creating order with amount: 295000 paise
[RAZORPAY] Using key ID: rzp_test_R...
[RAZORPAY] Error creating order: Authentication failed
[RAZORPAY] Error type: BadRequestError
```

### Root Cause
The Razorpay SDK is attempting to authenticate with test keys from `.env`:
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_RBrPafmy42Nmd7
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=5TVK1iA2npjluW6vDb0EXIn1
```

However, the Razorpay API is rejecting these credentials. Possible reasons:
1. Keys are outdated or from a different account
2. Keys are in incorrect format
3. Network connectivity issue
4. Razorpay account restrictions

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Real Razorpay Test Keys
**Pros**: Uses real Razorpay API, production-ready  
**Cons**: Requires Razorpay account setup

**Steps**:
1. Create Razorpay account at https://razorpay.com
2. Get test keys from dashboard
3. Update `.env` with real keys
4. Restart backend

### Option 2: Use Mock Razorpay Service (RECOMMENDED FOR DEV)
**Pros**: No external dependencies, fast testing, predictable  
**Cons**: Not real Razorpay API

**Steps**:
1. Create `backend/app/services/razorpay_mock_service.py`
2. Add `USE_RAZORPAY_MOCK=true` to `.env`
3. Update service initialization in `razorpay_service.py`
4. Restart backend

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/.env`
- Updated Razorpay keys with test credentials from README
- Status: ✅ Updated

### 2. `backend/app/services/razorpay_service.py`
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Added try-catch with traceback
- Status: ✅ Enhanced with logging

### 3. `backend/app/api/auth.py`
- Fixed missing `datetime` import (from previous session)
- Status: ✅ Already fixed
