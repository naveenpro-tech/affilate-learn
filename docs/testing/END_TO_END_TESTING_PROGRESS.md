## 🎯 Critical Bug Fixed

### Issue: Registration with Referral Code Failing
**Error**: `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: notifications`

**Root Cause**: The `notifications` table was not being created before attempting to insert referral notifications during user registration.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added table creation logic to the registration endpoint
- Modified `backend/app/api/auth.py` line 50-65 to ensure `Notification.__table__.create()` is called before any notification operations

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Referral users can now register successfully

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Main User (Naveen) Setup
- ✅ Naveen (naveenvide@gmail.com) already has Silver package purchased
- ✅ Referral code: **OZGQF3QE**
- ✅ Can login and access dashboard
- ✅ Payment system working with Mock Razorpay service

### Infrastructure Improvements
- ✅ Mock Razorpay Service implemented (bypasses authentication issues)
- ✅ Rate limit increased from 5/hour to 100/hour for testing
- ✅ Notification table creation fixed
- ✅ Backend running on port 8000 with auto-reload
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3000

## 🔄 In Progress Tasks

### Phase 2: Referral Users Registration & Purchases
**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Completed**:
- ✅ User 1 (referral_user_1@test.com) - Registered with Naveen's referral code
- ✅ User 2 (referral_user_2@test.com) - Registered with Naveen's referral code  
- ✅ User 3 (referral_user_3@test.com) - Registered with Naveen's referral code
- ✅ Referral notifications created for Naveen
- ✅ Payment orders created for all 3 users

**Pending**:
- ⏳ Payment verification (UNIQUE constraint issue on razorpay_payment_id)
- ⏳ GUI testing for complete purchase flow
- ⏳ Commission calculation verification

**Issue Found**: Payment verification failing due to UNIQUE constraint on `razorpay_payment_id` when using same mock payment ID for multiple payments. Need to generate unique payment IDs per transaction.

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### Phase 3: Commission & Payout Flow
- [ ] Verify commissions earned from 3 referrals
- [ ] Request payout for earned commissions
- [ ] Admin approval of payout requests
- [ ] Wallet balance updates

### Phase 4: Additional Features
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] User profile updates
- [ ] Wallet transactions history
- [ ] Individual course purchases

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Payment Verification UNIQUE Constraint**
   - Using same mock payment ID for all payments causes database constraint violation
   - Solution: Generate unique payment IDs in verification requests

2. **Email Service Not Running**
   - SMTP server not available (localhost:1025)
   - Emails fail but don't block registration (graceful degradation)
   - Status: Expected in development environment

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Fix Payment Verification**
   - Generate unique payment IDs for each transaction
   - Re-run payment verification for all 3 users

2. **GUI Testing**
   - Test complete purchase flow through browser
   - Verify commission calculations
   - Test payout flow

3. **Final Validation**
   - End-to-end flow from registration → purchase → commission → payout
   - All features working as expected
