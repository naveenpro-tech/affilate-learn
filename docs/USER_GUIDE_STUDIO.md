**Use Descriptive Language**

### Prompt Structure
```
[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Setting] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Details]
```

**Example:**
"A majestic lion (subject) roaring (action) on a rocky cliff (setting), oil painting style (style), golden hour lighting (lighting), highly detailed fur and dramatic sky (details)"
