## 📦 Deliverables

### Backend (2 files modified)

#### 1. **`backend/app/api/studio.py`**
**Changes:**
- Added imports: `UploadFile`, `File`, `tempfile`, `os`, `Path`, `CloudinaryService`
- Created `/api/studio/upload-source-image` endpoint

**New Endpoint:**
```python
@router.post("/upload-source-image")
async def upload_source_image(
    file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
):
    """
    Upload a source image for remixing
    POST /api/studio/upload-source-image
    
    Accepts: JPEG, PNG images up to 10MB
    Returns: {url: string, public_id: string, width: int, height: int}
    """
```

**Features:**
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG only)
- File size validation (max 10MB)
- Upload to Cloudinary (`remix/user_{user_id}` folder)
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Error handling with detailed messages

#### 2. **`backend/app/schemas/studio.py`**
**Changes:**
- Added `source_image_url: Optional[str]` to `GenerateImageRequest`
- Added `source_post_id: Optional[int]` to `GenerateImageRequest`

**Purpose:**
- Enable remix/style transfer functionality
- Track which post is being remixed for analytics

### Frontend (3 new components)

#### 3. **`frontend/components/mobile/CameraCapture.tsx`** (210 lines)
**Purpose:** Full-screen camera capture interface

**Features:**
- ✅ getUserMedia API integration
- ✅ Front/back camera toggle
- ✅ Video preview with live feed
- ✅ Capture button (white circle)
- ✅ Close button (top-left)
- ✅ Flip camera button (top-right)
- ✅ Loading state while starting camera
- ✅ Error handling for permission denied
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on close
- ✅ Canvas-based photo capture
- ✅ JPEG output (90% quality)

**UI Design:**
- Full-screen black background
- Gradient overlays for buttons
- White capture button (80px diameter)
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)

#### 4. **`frontend/components/mobile/ImagePreview.tsx`** (110 lines)
**Purpose:** Preview selected photo before upload

**Features:**
- ✅ Full-screen image preview
- ✅ Cancel button (bottom-left)
- ✅ Confirm button (bottom-right, purple)
- ✅ Upload progress indicator
- ✅ Disabled state during upload
- ✅ Gradient overlays for readability
- ✅ Smooth animations (Framer Motion)

**UI Design:**
- Black background
- Image centered with `object-contain`
- Purple confirm button (`#667eea`)
- White cancel button with transparency
- Upload spinner with "Uploading..." text

#### 5. **`frontend/components/mobile/RemixModal.tsx`** (Updated, 283 lines)
**Purpose:** Orchestrate photo selection flow

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added camera capture integration
- ✅ Added gallery picker integration
- ✅ Added image preview integration
- ✅ Added file validation (type, size)
- ✅ Added upload to backend
- ✅ Added toast notifications
- ✅ Updated callback signature: `onPhotoSelected(file, sourceImageUrl)`
- ✅ Removed placeholder alerts

**New State:**
```typescript
const [showCamera, setShowCamera] = useState(false);
const [showPreview, setShowPreview] = useState(false);
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [previewUrl, setPreviewUrl] = useState<string>('');
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
```

**Flow:**
1. User taps "Take Photo" → Opens CameraCapture
2. User captures photo → Shows ImagePreview
3. User confirms → Uploads to backend
4. Backend returns URL → Calls `onPhotoSelected(file, url)`
5. Parent component receives URL → Can proceed with generation

**Validation:**
- File type: JPEG, PNG only
- File size: Max 10MB
- Toast error messages for validation failures

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Camera Capture Flow
```typescript
1. User taps "Take Photo"
2. Request camera permission (getUserMedia)
3. Show video preview
4. User taps capture button
5. Draw video frame to canvas
6. Convert canvas to blob (JPEG, 90% quality)
7. Create File object
8. Stop camera stream
9. Call onCapture(file)
```

### Gallery Picker Flow
```typescript
1. User taps "Choose from Gallery"
2. Trigger hidden file input click
3. User selects file
4. Validate file (type, size)
5. Create preview URL (URL.createObjectURL)
6. Show ImagePreview
```

### Upload Flow
```typescript
1. User confirms in ImagePreview
2. Create FormData with file
3. POST to /api/studio/upload-source-image
4. Backend validates and uploads to Cloudinary
5. Backend returns {url, public_id, width, height}
6. Call onPhotoSelected(file, url)
7. Close all modals
8. Show success toast
```

## 🚧 Known Limitations

### Phase 2 Scope
- ❌ **No generation integration** (deferred to Phase 3)
- ❌ **No progress tracking** (deferred to Phase 3)
- ❌ **No image optimization** (full-size uploads)
- ❌ **No thumbnail generation** (uses full image)

### Browser Compatibility
- ⚠️ **Camera capture requires HTTPS** (or localhost)
- ⚠️ **getUserMedia not supported on old browsers**
- ⚠️ **File input works everywhere** (fallback)

### Performance
- ⚠️ **Large images (10MB) may be slow on 3G**
- ⚠️ **No client-side compression** (uploads full file)
- ⚠️ **No image resizing** (backend receives full resolution)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 3 - Day 5)

### Remix API Integration
- [ ] Update feed page to handle `onPhotoSelected` callback
- [ ] Call `/api/studio/generate` with `source_image_url`
- [ ] Pass `source_post_id` for analytics
- [ ] Show generation progress modal
- [ ] Handle credit deduction
- [ ] Navigate to result on success

### Generation Request
```typescript
const response = await studioAPI.generateImage(
  originalPost.title, // Use original prompt as base
  'standard', // tier
  undefined, // templateId
  true, // watermark
  false, // enhancePrompt
  'auto', // provider
  sourceImageUrl, // NEW: uploaded photo URL
  originalPost.id // NEW: source post ID
);
```
