## üß™ Manual Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend server must be running:**
   ```bash
   cd affilate-learn/backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Frontend server must be running:**
   ```bash
   cd affilate-learn/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Note:** If you encounter a git hook error (`git: 'commit-m' is not a git command`), try:
   ```bash
   npx next dev -p 3000
   ```

3. **Ensure you have test data:**
   - At least 5-10 community posts in the database
   - Posts should have images, titles, authors

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No Photo Upload:**
   - Remix modal shows placeholder alerts
   - Camera/gallery integration deferred to Phase 2

2. **No Virtual Scrolling:**
   - All posts loaded in memory
   - May cause performance issues with 100+ posts
   - Virtual scrolling planned for Phase 2

3. **No Image Preloading:**
   - Images load on demand
   - May cause brief loading delay when swiping
   - Preloading planned for Phase 2

4. **No Thumbnail Optimization:**
   - Serves full-size images
   - May be slow on 3G networks
   - Thumbnail generation planned for Phase 2

### Backend Gaps

1. **Avatar URL:**
   - Returns null if user has no profile
   - Frontend shows placeholder (first letter of username)

2. **Comments Count:**
   - Counted on every request (not cached)
   - May be slow with many comments
   - Consider adding `comments_count` column to `community_posts` table
