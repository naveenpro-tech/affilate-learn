## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking):

1. **Old Images 404**
   - **Issue:** Images generated before path fix return 404
   - **Impact:** Low (only affects old test images)
   - **Fix:** Files don't exist, expected behavior

2. **HuggingFace Prompt Enhancement Rate Limiting**
   - **Issue:** Sometimes returns 404 when model is loading
   - **Impact:** Low (fallback to original prompt works)
   - **Fix:** Already implemented (graceful fallback)

3. **Provider Quota Limits**
   - **Issue:** OpenAI billing limit, Gemini quota exhausted
   - **Impact:** Low (expected for free tiers)
   - **Fix:** Use Mock or HuggingFace for testing
