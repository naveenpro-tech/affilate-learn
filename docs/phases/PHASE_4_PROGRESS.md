## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Comments System Architecture

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES community_posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_comments_post_id ON comments(post_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_user_id ON comments(user_id);
```

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "post_id": 5,
      "user_id": 2,
      "user_name": "john_doe",
      "text": "Amazing artwork!",
      "created_at": "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": null,
      "is_own": false
    }
  ],
  "total": 15,
  "skip": 0,
  "limit": 50
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
// Get comments
const response = await studioAPI.getComments(postId, 0, 50);
const comments = response.data.items;

// Create comment
await studioAPI.createComment(postId, "Great work!");

// Delete comment
await studioAPI.deleteComment(commentId);
```
