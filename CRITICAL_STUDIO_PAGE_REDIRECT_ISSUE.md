# CRITICAL ISSUE: Studio Page Redirecting to Dashboard

## Problem Description

The `/studio` page (and other protected pages like `/packages`) are redirecting to `/dashboard` after briefly loading. This is blocking all GUI testing and development.

## Symptoms

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/studio`
2. Page loads briefly (URL changes to `/studio`, page content starts rendering)
3. After ~3-5 seconds, automatic redirect to `/dashboard`
4. No errors visible in browser console
5. Backend API calls are succeeding (returning 200 OK)

## Investigation Done

### 1. File Verification ✅
- Studio page file exists: `frontend/app/studio/page.tsx` (24,835 bytes)
- No TypeScript errors
- No syntax errors
- File structure is correct

### 2. Backend API ✅
- Backend server running on port 8000
- API endpoints responding correctly:
  - `GET /api/studio/credits/balance` → 200 OK
  - `GET /api/wallet/` → 200 OK
- No CORS errors
- Authentication working correctly

### 3. Frontend Server ✅
- Frontend running on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)
- Next.js dev server started successfully
- No build errors (after clearing `.next` cache)

### 4. Authentication ✅
- User successfully logged in as admin (naveenvide@gmail.com)
- Auth token stored in localStorage
- `/api/auth/me` returning user data correctly

### 5. Code Analysis ✅
- **ProtectedRoute component**: No redirect logic found for this case
  - Only redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
  - Only redirects to `/dashboard` if `requireAdmin=true` and user is not admin
  - Studio page does NOT have `requireAdmin=true`
- **Studio page useEffect**: No redirect logic
  - Only loads balances and shows toast on error
  - No `router.push()` or `router.replace()` calls
- **DashboardLayout**: No redirect logic
- **Sidebar**: No redirect logic (only uses `pathname` for highlighting)
- **No middleware files** found in frontend
- **No error pages** found
- **No Next.js redirects** configured in `next.config.ts`

### 6. Network Analysis ✅
- API calls succeeding on backend
- No 403 Forbidden errors (except when token expired, which was fixed by re-login)
- No 404 errors
- No 500 errors

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Restarted backend server
2. ✅ Restarted frontend server
3. ✅ Cleared Next.js cache (`.next` directory)
4. ✅ Re-logged in as admin user
5. ✅ Tried direct URL navigation
6. ✅ Tried JavaScript redirect (`window.location.href`)
7. ✅ Tried clicking sidebar menu items
8. ❌ Temporarily removed ProtectedRoute wrapper (caused build errors)

## Current Status

**BLOCKED**: Unable to access studio page or any other protected pages. All attempts to navigate to `/studio` result in automatic redirect to `/dashboard` after ~3-5 seconds.

## Possible Root Causes (Unconfirmed)

1. **Race condition in auth state**: The `isAuthenticated` state might be changing after the page loads, triggering the ProtectedRoute redirect logic
2. **Hidden redirect in parent component**: There might be a redirect in a parent component that we haven't found yet
3. **Next.js routing issue**: There might be a Next.js routing configuration or bug causing the redirect
4. **Browser caching**: The browser might be caching an old version of the page that has redirect logic
5. **Service worker**: There might be a service worker intercepting requests and redirecting

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Debugging (Recommended)
1. Add console.log statements to ProtectedRoute component to track state changes
2. Add console.log statements to studio page useEffect to track execution
3. Use React DevTools to inspect component state and props
4. Use browser DevTools to set breakpoints and step through code execution
5. Check for any service workers or browser extensions that might be interfering

### Option 2: Bypass ProtectedRoute
1. Create a temporary version of the studio page without ProtectedRoute wrapper
2. Test if the page loads correctly without protection
3. If it works, investigate ProtectedRoute component more deeply
4. If it doesn't work, the issue is in the page itself

### Option 3: Fresh Start
1. Create a minimal test page (e.g., `/test-studio`) with just basic content
2. Gradually add features until the redirect appears
3. Identify the exact component or code causing the redirect

### Option 4: Check Browser State
1. Clear all browser cache, cookies, and localStorage
2. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
3. Try in a different browser
4. Check for browser extensions that might be interfering

## Files Modified During Investigation

- `frontend/app/studio/page.tsx` - Temporarily removed ProtectedRoute (reverted)
- `backend/.env` - No changes
- `backend/app/api/studio.py` - Fixed job_id type conversion, credit transaction flow, status endpoint
- `backend/app/schemas/studio.py` - Added credits_used field
- `backend/app/services/local_storage_service.py` - Created
- `backend/app/services/image_generation_service.py` - Updated all adapters for local storage
- `backend/app/main.py` - Added static files mounting

## Impact

- ❌ Cannot test image generation feature
- ❌ Cannot test prompt enhancement feature
- ❌ Cannot verify credits balance fix
- ❌ Cannot test Hugging Face integration
- ❌ Cannot complete any GUI testing tasks
- ❌ Cannot proceed with remaining development tasks

## Request for User Input

**User, I need your help to resolve this critical issue. I've investigated extensively but cannot find the root cause of the redirect. Please advise on how you'd like to proceed:**

1. Should I continue manual debugging with console.log statements?
2. Should I try creating a minimal test page to isolate the issue?
3. Should I check if there's a browser/environment-specific issue?
4. Do you have any insights or suggestions based on your experience with this codebase?

**The issue is blocking all progress on the studio feature. Your guidance would be greatly appreciated.**
