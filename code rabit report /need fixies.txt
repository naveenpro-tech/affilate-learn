Fix the following issues. The issues can be from different files or can overlap on same lines in one file.

- In DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md around lines 189 to 224, the Environment Variables block exposes placeholder secrets without a clear, prominent security warning; prepend a strong, visible warning statement that real secrets must never be committed to version control and explain immediate remediation steps: keep secrets out of the repo, store them in a .env file that is gitignored or use a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Actions Secrets, Vault), reference environment variables via CI/CD settings, and rotate/revoke any credentials accidentally committed; ensure the warning is short, urgent, and placed before the code block so readers see it before the example.

- In FIXES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE.md around line 13, the Hugging Face API key is hardcoded and must be removed immediately; revoke the exposed key in your Hugging Face account, delete the key line from this file, and replace any usage with a reference to an environment variable (HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY) stored in a .env or secrets manager. After revocation and replacement, generate a new key, add HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=new_key to your local .env, ensure .env is listed in .gitignore, and rotate any credentials that may have depended on the compromised key; also consider purging the key from git history (e.g., using git filter-repo or BFG) if required by policy.

- In GET_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY.md around lines 22, 31, 57, 68, 96, 102 and 108, several fenced code blocks lack language identifiers; update each triple-backtick fence to include a language tag (e.g., ```plaintext or ```text) to ensure proper syntax highlighting and rendering, changing the opening fences at those line numbers to include the chosen tag while leaving the block contents unchanged.

- In GET_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY.md around line 148, the bare URL should be wrapped in Markdown link syntax; replace the plain URL with a Markdown link (for example, convert "https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens" to a link such as [Hugging Face tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) or wrap the URL in [ ]( ) so the line becomes consistent with Markdown conventions.

- In MULTI_PROVIDER_IMAGE_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md around line 82 (and also lines 84 and 198-199), real API keys are committed; remove these keys immediately and replace the literal values with a short placeholder or instruction that the key must be provided via environment variables (e.g., reference OPENAI_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY), then commit the cleaned file; next, revoke/regenerate the exposed OpenAI and GCP/Gemini keys in their consoles right away; add .env and related files to .gitignore (ensure .env, .env.local, .env.*.local are present) and update any README to show how to set environment variables instead of embedding keys; finally, run a repo-wide search for other exposed credentials and remove/rotate anything found.

- In PROMPT_ENHANCEMENT_UX_IMPROVED.md around line 251, a live GCP API key is exposed in the documentation and must be removed and replaced with a safe placeholder; delete the hardcoded key line, replace it with a note instructing users to set GOOGLE_API_KEY in their environment (e.g., .env) and ensure .env is gitignored, and then follow the reviewer’s instructions to immediately revoke the exposed key in the Google Cloud Console and regenerate a new key stored only in environment variables and never committed to the repository or its history.

- In STUDIO_FEATURE_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md around lines 126 to 138 there is an exposed Hugging Face API token; revoke that token immediately, remove the literal token from the file and replace it with a placeholder (e.g. HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<REDACTED> or HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_token_here), add a short note instructing readers to store real tokens in environment variables or a secrets manager (and not in version control), and update repository docs or add a .env.example to demonstrate the expected variable name without any secrets.

- In backend/Dockerfile around lines 29-30, the HEALTHCHECK uses "import requests" which will fail if the requests package isn't installed and also lacks exception handling; either (A) install curl in the image (add the appropriate package install line for your base image, e.g., apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl) and replace the HEALTHCHECK to use curl against http://localhost:8000/health, or (B) ensure requests is added to the app's requirements (requirements.txt) and change the HEALTHCHECK to a small Python one-liner using the stdlib (urllib) or wrap requests call in try/except to return non-zero on failure; pick one approach and update the Dockerfile accordingly so the healthcheck reliably runs without missing dependencies and handles errors.

- In backend/app/api/admin.py around lines 1128-1144 (and also apply to 1155-1168), the code calls datetime.utcnow() but datetime is not imported; add a proper import for datetime at the top of the file (e.g., from datetime import datetime) so datetime.utcnow() resolves, and ensure the same import covers the other block mentioned.

- In backend/app/api/admin.py around lines 1024 to 1046, the code incorrectly reads post.image_url which doesn’t exist on CommunityPost; update the logic to access the image URL through the related image object safely: replace post.image_url with post.image.image_url, guarding for post and post.image being None (e.g., post.image.image_url if post and post.image else None) so post_image_url returns None when absent.

- In backend/app/api/admin.py around lines 902-905 (and similarly at 934-936 for update_template), remove the invalid assignment db_template.category_name = category.name because ImageTemplate has no such field; instead ensure the response includes category_name by adding it during serialization (either extend the Pydantic response schema to include category_name and populate it from the category relationship, or return a dict/response model like {**db_template.dict(), "category_name": category.name} so the value is included without mutating the ORM model).

- In backend/app/api/admin.py around lines 104 to 110, the CreditLedger query uses non-existent fields transaction_type and amount; change the aggregation to sum the model's delta field and filter on reason values instead (e.g., reason == 'purchase' and reason == 'generation') so credits_purchased and credits_spent use func.sum(CreditLedger.delta) with the correct reason filters; keep the existing fallback to 0 when scalar() returns None.

- In backend/app/api/analytics.py around line 143, replace the explicit boolean comparison "Comment.is_deleted == False" with a Pythonic negation using "not Comment.is_deleted" to follow Ruff E712 and improve readability; update any related conditional or filter expression accordingly so behavior remains identical.

- In backend/app/api/comments.py around lines 98 to 120, there's an N+1 query: the main query joins User but then performs a separate db.query(User) inside the loop for every comment. Remove the per-comment User query and use the Comment.user relationship (e.g., comment.user.username if comment.user else "Unknown") when building CommentResponse, and ensure the initial query eagerly loads users (use joinedload or selectinload on Comment.user) so user data is fetched in the main query rather than per-iteration.

- In backend/app/api/community.py around lines 685 to 701, the code incorrectly accesses post.image_url and user.name; change the enrichment to read the image URL from post.image.image_url (guarding for post.image being None) and use user.full_name instead of user.name (guarding for user being None), i.e. set 'image_url' to post.image.image_url if post.image else None and 'author_name' to user.full_name if user else 'Unknown'.

- In backend/app/api/community.py around lines 620 to 653, the handler incorrectly accesses user.name which doesn't exist on the User model; change all references to user.name to user.full_name (e.g., return 'user_name': user.full_name), keeping the rest of the response the same and preserving member_since logic.

- In backend/app/api/studio.py around lines 205 to 218, the code logs debit failures then continues (pass), which allows free generations; change this so that on debit failure you do not persist a completed/paid image without handling payment: either abort the save and raise/return a 4xx/5xx error so the generated asset is not attached to the user, or persist the asset with a payment_pending flag and clear indication it is unpaid (and enqueue a retry/notification for billing); to implement safely, wrap generation+debit+save in a database transaction or perform the credit debit before committing the final image record, log detailed error context and return an appropriate error response if aborting, or set payment_pending=True and record the failed debit reason/ref_id for reconciliation if choosing the unpaid path.

- 

- In backend/app/api/studio.py around line 506, the fallback reference_id currently uses f"wallet-purchase-{current_user.id}-{int(cost_in_rupees)}" which can collide for repeated purchases of the same amount; change the fallback to append a unique suffix (for example a short UUID or a high-resolution timestamp) so each generated reference_id is unique (e.g., generate uuid4() or time.time_ns() and concatenate or format it into the reference_id); alternatively, if idempotency behavior is required, derive a stable id from the idempotency-related inputs instead of the current deterministic string.

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 160 to 169, the current regex-based validate_url is too restrictive and rejects valid URLs (ports, IPs, localhost, queries, fragments); replace the regex approach with urllib.parse.urlparse: ensure the function returns False for empty input, parse the URL, verify scheme is 'http' or 'https' and that result.netloc is non-empty (this will allow hostnames, localhost, IPs and ports), and catch any exceptions to return False.

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 180-192, the current naive pattern removals are easily bypassed (spacing, unicode homoglyphs, leets); fix by first normalizing the prompt (Unicode NFKC), fold width and case, remove/normalize zero-width and combining chars, and collapse interstitial whitespace so tokens like "i g n o r e" become contiguous; expand the dangerous-pattern regexes to use word-boundaries and character classes that allow common separators/leet variants (e.g., optional non-word separators between letters) or build canonicalized tokens for matching, apply re.IGNORECASE after normalization, and add a short comment and telemetry/logging for flagged matches plus a note that this is only a deterrent and recommend pairing with rate-limiting and output validation.

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 135-136, the current code logs the matched profanity word then raises an error; change the logger call to avoid including the actual word (e.g., log a generic message like "Profanity detected in input" or log a masked indicator) and keep raising the ValueError as-is; do not log or persist the raw offending token anywhere, and update any related tests or comments to reflect the non-revealing log message.

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 142 to 143, remove the call to sanitize_sql(sanitized) because it corrupts legitimate input; instead delete the sanitize_sql invocation and any related import if no longer used, and ensure all database access uses parameterized queries (or prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection; run/update unit tests to cover inputs containing SQL keywords to confirm they remain unchanged and that parameterized DB calls are used where this sanitized value is consumed.

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 210 to 220, remove the call to sanitize_user_input (which invokes sanitize_sql and strips SQL keywords) and replace it with tag-specific handling: trim whitespace, truncate to max 50 characters, remove characters except letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores (use the existing regex), collapse multiple hyphens/underscores if desired, then lowercase and append only non-empty results; ensure no SQL-specific sanitizers are invoked so legitimate tags like "select-color" remain intact.

- 

- In backend/app/core/sanitization.py around lines 73 to 76, the truncation logic uses rsplit('.', 1) which only preserves the last extension (losing intermediate extensions like ".tar" in "file.tar.gz"); change to preserve the full extension sequence by splitting at the first dot (except handle leading-dot hidden files): if the filename contains a dot and is not a leading-dot-only name, treat everything from the first dot onward as the extension (ext = sanitized[ sanitized.find('.') : ] ) and the part before it as the base; then truncate the base to max_length - len(ext) (guarding for non-positive space) and rejoin base + ext; otherwise truncate the whole name to max_length. Ensure you handle filenames that start with a dot (e.g., ".env") as a single name with no separate base+ext.

- In backend/app/schemas/studio.py around lines 309 to 324, an existing class ImageCategoryCreate (also defined at line 18) is being redefined which will shadow the earlier model; rename this admin-specific schema (e.g., ImageCategoryAdminCreate or AdminImageCategoryCreate), update all local references and imports (including any API endpoints, routers, serializers, and tests) to use the new name, and ensure the Response model remains unchanged; run type checks/tests to catch any missing references.

- In backend/app/schemas/studio.py around lines 288 to 306, the admin variant of ImageTemplateCreate reuses the same class name as an earlier definition (line 46), shadowing the original; rename this admin class (e.g., ImageTemplateCreateAdmin or AdminImageTemplateCreate) and update all imports and API endpoint type annotations, request/response uses, and tests to reference the new name so both schemas coexist without collision.

- In backend/app/services/local_storage_service.py around lines 97-115 (delete_image) and lines 131-136 (get_file_path), the code currently builds a file path from the URL without validating it, which allows directory traversal via ../ segments; update both methods to resolve the candidate path to an absolute, normalized path (resolving symlinks if needed) and then verify that the resolved path is a child of self.base_dir (e.g., by comparing Path.resolve() prefixes or using Path.commonpath); if the resolved path is outside self.base_dir, log an error/warning and return False / raise an appropriate error instead of operating on the file, otherwise proceed to delete or return the path as before.

- In backend/app/services/notification_service.py around lines 6 to 16, the function create_notification uses None defaults but non-Optional type hints; import Optional from typing and change the signature to annotate optional parameters as Optional[T] (e.g. link: Optional[str], post_id: Optional[int], comment_id: Optional[int], from_user_id: Optional[int]) so the type hints correctly reflect that these args may be None.

- In backend/app/services/prompt_enhancement_service.py around lines 138 to 147, the module-level singleton _prompt_enhancer_service is lazily initialized without synchronization causing a race condition under concurrent calls; add a module-level threading.Lock (or RLock), then implement double-checked locking inside get_prompt_enhancement_service: first check if _prompt_enhancer_service is None, if so acquire the lock, check again, create and assign PromptEnhancementService(), release the lock and return the instance; ensure the lock and the optional instance are declared at module scope and use typing.Optional as already done.

- In backend/app/services/reward_service.py around lines 165 to 197, the current check can race under concurrent requests because two transactions can both see no existing reward and each insert one; to fix it, enforce uniqueness at the DB level (add a unique constraint/index on the combination of user_id, reference_type and the reward date or add a dedicated reward_date column) and change the function to perform the award inside a transaction that either SELECTs the relevant row FOR UPDATE or attempts the insert and handles IntegrityError/unique constraint violations gracefully (treat constraint violation as "already awarded"); also replace logger.error with logging.exception (or logger.exception) in the except block to capture the traceback.

- 

- In backend/app/services/reward_service.py around lines 62 to 83, the current check uses post_count == 1 which can race and double-award if two posts are created concurrently; instead enforce a DB-side uniqueness and make the award idempotent: add a unique constraint/index on the ledger table for (user_id, reference_type) (e.g. "first_post"), then change the flow to either (a) perform the award insert into the ledger inside a transaction and rely on catching IntegrityError to ignore duplicate inserts, or (b) within a transaction SELECT FOR UPDATE the user/ledger row before inserting; update award_credits to attempt to create a ledger entry with reference_type="first_post" and handle IntegrityError by not granting credits a second time. Also replace logger.error(...) in the except block with logger.exception(...) to capture the traceback.

- 

- In backend/app/services/reward_service.py around lines 12 to 19, the function signature uses `reference_id: int = None` which is not PEP 484 compliant; change the type hint to `Optional[int]` and import Optional from typing if not already imported, updating the parameter to `reference_id: Optional[int] = None` to correctly reflect that the value may be None.

- In backend/create_studio_tables.py around line 1, the file contains a shebang but is not marked executable; either make it executable if it should be runnable directly by adding execute permissions (run: chmod +x backend/create_studio_tables.py) or remove the shebang line if the script will only be invoked via the python command; choose one of these fixes and commit the change.

- 

- 

- In backend/scripts/mint_token.py around line 11, replace the assertion "assert user, 'Admin user not found'" with proper runtime error handling: check if user is falsy and, if so, raise a clear exception (e.g., RuntimeError or ValueError) with the same message or log the error and exit with a non‑zero status; ensure the error message includes context ("Admin user not found") so callers or logs can diagnose the failure.

- In backend/scripts/mint_token.py around line 10, remove the hardcoded email value and accept the email as a command-line argument instead; parse the email (e.g., via argparse or sys.argv), validate it's present and looks like an email, and then use that variable in the DB query (db.query(User).filter(User.email==email).first()); ensure the script exits with a clear error if the argument is missing or invalid and update usage/help text accordingly.

- In backend/scripts/seed_demo_data.py around line 73, the loop uses enumerate to produce an unused idx variable; remove the unused variable by iterating directly over courses_data (e.g., change the loop to for (title, pkg_id, desc, thumb, order) in courses_data:) or if an index is needed later, keep enumerate but rename idx to _ to indicate it's intentionally unused.

- In backend/scripts/seed_demo_data.py around lines 58 to 70, the script only checks for the existence of any Package but later hardcodes package IDs 1,2,3 when creating courses; update the validation to explicitly ensure those package IDs exist before using them: query the DB for packages with IDs {1,2,3}, collect their IDs, and if any are missing either abort with a clear error message listing which IDs are absent (ask user to seed those specific packages) or create the missing packages programmatically; proceed to use the validated package IDs when building courses to avoid foreign key constraint failures.

- 

- In docs/audit/AUDIT_FIXES_COMPLETE.md around line 3, the document date is incorrect (January 15, 2025) and should match the PR timeline; update the date string to the correct PR creation date "October 20, 2025" (or the accurate date the fixes were applied) so the file reflects the actual timeline.

- 

- In docs/completed/ADMIN_FRONTEND_COMPLETE.md around lines 224, 233 and 245 the fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers; update each triple-backtick fence to include the bash language (change ``` to ```bash) for those blocks so they render with proper syntax highlighting and conform to Markdown standards.

- In docs/completed/ADMIN_FRONTEND_COMPLETE.md around lines 307 to 309, the status lines contain bare URLs; update each to use Markdown link syntax by replacing the plain URLs with bracketed link text followed by the URL in parentheses (for example "Backend: ✅ Running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)"), doing the same for the frontend and API Docs entries so all three lines use consistent Markdown links.

- docs/completed/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md lines 49-86, and additionally the blocks at lines 78, 90, 102, 113-128, 134-143: several fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers; update each fenced block to include the appropriate tag (use ```env for the environment variables block around line 49, and ```bash for shell/URL/curl/database command blocks at lines 78, 90, 102, 113-128, and 134-143) so syntax highlighting and tooling recognize the content.

- In docs/completed/UI_UX_FIXES_SUMMARY.md around lines 63 and 301–303, there are bare URLs that need to be wrapped in Markdown link syntax; replace the plain URL instances (e.g., http://localhost:3000/admin/courses and the three resource links) with the bracketed form [URL](URL) so they render as clickable links, preserving surrounding backticks/code blocks and list formatting.

- In docs/completed/UI_UX_FIXES_SUMMARY.md around line 38 (also apply to lines 142, 151, 159, 173), several fenced code blocks lack language identifiers; update each opening triple-backtick to include the appropriate language tag (e.g., ```bash or ```shell for shell commands, ```http for HTTP examples, ```tsx for React/TSX snippets) so syntax highlighting renders correctly and Markdown conventions are followed.

- In docs/completed/UI_UX_FIXES_SUMMARY.md around lines 27 to 33, the Markdown table is not surrounded by blank lines which can break rendering; add a blank line before the table start and a blank line after the table end so the table is separated from surrounding paragraphs and renders correctly in Markdown.

- In docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md around lines 26 to 59, this file contains real secrets (Neon DB URL with password, SMTP password, Razorpay keys, Cloudinary secret) that must be removed and rotated immediately; replace all secret values with clearly named placeholders (e.g. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require), create a docs/deployment/.env.example or .env.sample with only placeholders, add docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md to .gitignore or ensure credentials are not committed, and update the PR to state that all exposed credentials have been rotated and consider rewriting git history (and contact security) if the repo has public or wide distribution.

- In docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md around lines 38-60 the file contains actual production credentials (Neon DB connection string, SMTP password, Razorpay keys, Cloudinary keys); remove these secrets and replace each value with clearly named placeholders (e.g., DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>, SECRET_KEY=<GENERATE_NEW_SECRET_KEY>, SMTP_PASSWORD=<YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD>, RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<YOUR_LIVE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID>, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<YOUR_LIVE_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET>, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_SECRET>), commit the sanitized file, and immediately rotate/revoke the exposed credentials to ensure they are invalidated.

- In docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md around lines 47-49, plaintext admin credentials are exposed; remove the real email/password from the document and replace them with a non-sensitive placeholder (e.g. "Admin credentials stored in your secrets manager — see deployment playbook"), add a short one-line warning instructing operators to rotate/change any default credentials immediately after first login, add a note pointing to the secure secrets management location or procedure for retrieving credentials, and ensure this file is excluded from public releases (or moved behind access control).

- 

- docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md around lines 122 to 142: this block contains hardcoded production credentials and duplicates that must be removed or replaced; replace every secret/API key/password value with clear placeholder tokens (e.g. DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING>, SECRET_KEY=<GENERATE_WITH: openssl rand -hex 32>, SMTP_PASSWORD=<YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD>, RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID>, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET>, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY>, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET>, etc.), remove any duplicated credential blocks elsewhere (specifically the Render environment variables section) or ensure they reference the same placeholders, and do not include any real production secrets in the file.

- In docs/features/COMMUNITY_AI_STUDIO_CHECKLIST.md around lines 18-46, the Phase 1 checklist still shows all backend/frontend/QA items as incomplete despite PHASE_1_PROGRESS_UPDATE.md and completion documents indicating many tasks are done; update the checklist to mark completed items as checked ([x]) to reflect the actual implementation status by cross-referencing PHASE_1_PROGRESS_UPDATE.md and the completion docs, ensure each checked item lists the completion reference (file name and date or commit) in a short parenthetical note, and do not change the estimated times — only toggle checkboxes and add the reference notes for traceability.

- In docs/features/COMMUNITY_AI_STUDIO_CHECKLIST.md around line 4, the status line currently reads "Draft for approval (no development started)" but is inconsistent with existing progress artifacts; update the status to reflect the actual development progress (e.g., "In progress — development completed for PHASE_1..PHASE_4" or a more precise status after reviewing PHASE_1_PROGRESS_UPDATE.md, PHASE_2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md, PHASE_3_FINAL_SUMMARY.md and PHASE_4_PROGRESS.md), and edit the checklist items to mark completed tasks/PHASEs as done, remove or revise items that are no longer accurate, and ensure any dates or owner fields match the referenced reports.

- In docs/features/COMPLETE_COURSE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md around lines 14 and across ranges 27-67, 71, 161-199, 236-289, and 309-331, several fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers; update each triple-backtick fence to include the appropriate language tag (e.g., ```text or ```plaintext for database model blocks, ```python for Python snippets, ```json for JSON blocks, ```typescript for TypeScript snippets) so all code blocks have correct syntax-highlighting labels and consistent formatting.

- In docs/features/COURSE_MANAGEMENT_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md around line 3 and also at line 457 the date is incorrectly set to "January 15, 2025"; update both occurrences to the correct date "October 20, 2025" (matching the PR creation date) so the document no longer shows a future/incorrect date.

- docs/features/UNIFIED_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md lines 122-139 and 145-153: the fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers; update both opening triple-backtick fences to use ```plaintext so the blocks become ```plaintext ... ``` and ensure both occurrences (the block at ~122-139 and the block at ~145-153) are changed accordingly.

- In docs/features/UNIFIED_COURSE_WORKFLOW.md around lines 291 to 296, the Course List, Create Course, and Edit Course entries (lines 291–293) and the Modules Management entry (lines 294–296) use bare URLs; replace each bare URL with Markdown link syntax using the same visible text (e.g., change "http://localhost:3000/admin/courses" to "[http://localhost:3000/admin/courses](http://localhost:3000/admin/courses)" or preferably link the descriptive label like "[Course List](http://localhost:3000/admin/courses)"), updating all four lines so the URLs are wrapped in [text](url) form for proper rendering.

- In docs/guides/ALL_ISSUES_FIXED_SUMMARY.md around line 4, the document date is "January 15, 2025" which contradicts the PR creation date; update the date line to the correct date (October 20, 2025) and keep the existing formatting (e.g., "**Date:** October 20, 2025") so the document reflects the actual timing of these fixes.

- In docs/guides/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md around line 3, the document date is incorrect ("January 15, 2025") and is inconsistent with the PR timeline; update the date to match the PR creation date (October 20, 2025) or to the correct intended publication date, ensuring the format matches the rest of the document (e.g., "October 20, 2025") and commit the change.

- In docs/guides/PAYMENT_ISSUE_ANALYSIS_AND_FIX.md around lines 30 to 33, the file contains what appear to be live Razorpay test API keys; remove the actual key/secret and replace them with non-sensitive placeholders (e.g. RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXX and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXX), add a short note that these are placeholders, and if the values were ever valid instruct the team to rotate/revoke those test keys immediately and confirm revocation in the doc.

- In docs/guides/PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md around line 3 the "Generated: 2025-10-04" date is outdated; update that timestamp to the actual generation date (e.g., 2025-10-20 or the correct current date for this PR) by editing the line to reflect the accurate generation date so the report metadata matches when it was produced.

- In docs/guides/UI_UX_IMPROVEMENTS_PROGRESS.md around lines 3 to 5, the document header date "January 15, 2025" is inconsistent with other PR docs dated "2025-10-20"; update this file's date to the correct project-wide date (e.g., 2025-10-20) to match PHASE_4_PLAN.md and PHASE_1_MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN.md and scan the rest of the file for any other mismatched timestamps to make them consistent.

- In docs/guides/UI_UX_IMPROVEMENTS_PROGRESS.md around line 5, the header shows "Completed: 5/8 High Priority Items" which is inconsistent with the detailed progress (lines 11–258 and line 331) that count 7/8 completed; update the header at line 5 to read "Completed: 7/8 High Priority Items" so the summary matches the detailed breakdown and percentages.

- docs/newfeture/concept.md around lines 32 to 44 and also update the other affected code blocks in sections 4 (approx lines 40–42) and 6 (approx lines 132–144): the fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers, so edit the opening triple-backticks to include the appropriate language (e.g., ```python for Python snippets, ```text for plain flow examples or prose) so syntax highlighting works; apply the same change to all other fenced blocks mentioned in the review.

- docs/newfeture/concept.md lines 1-6 contain an informal conversational preamble ("Excellent concept 💡...") that must be removed; edit the file to delete lines 1–6 and ensure the document starts directly with the title or first formal section, preserving any remaining content and headings and keeping a professional, neutral documentation tone.

- In docs/newfeture/concept.md around lines 170 to 175, the three trailing open-ended questions create a conversational tone; replace them with a completed actionable choice or remove them. Either convert into a single definitive instruction (e.g., "Choose one: create a technical blueprint (diagram + file structure) for this microservice, or produce a mock UI design concept for the 'Creative Studio' dashboard page with credits, templates, and a generate button.") or delete the questions entirely so the document remains neutral and reference-style.

- In docs/newfeture/concpetread.md (referenced lines: 63, 128, 182, 205, 222, 263, 272), the fenced code blocks are missing language identifiers; update each opening triple-backtick to include the correct language: line 63 -> ```python, line 128 -> ```python, line 182 -> ```python (or the actual snippet language if different), line 205 -> ```bash (or shell commands), line 222 -> ```sql (database statements), line 263 -> ```python, line 272 -> ```bash (or the appropriate language); ensure each code fence uses the precise language tag matching the snippet for proper syntax highlighting.

- In docs/newfeture/concpetread.md around lines 220 to 225, the table-like block on line 222 lacks blank lines before and after it; add a blank line immediately above the table start and a blank line immediately after the table end so the table block is separated from surrounding content and renders correctly in Markdown.

- In docs/newfeture/concpetread.md lines 1–5 there is an informal conversational preamble ("Perfect 👍 Naveen — understood clearly..." etc.); remove lines 1–5 entirely so the file begins directly with the document title and body (previously at line 8), strip any remaining chat-style language or emojis from the top of the file, and ensure the first line is the clean title followed by the structured content.

- In docs/newfeture/concpetread.md around lines 50 to 75, there are multiple bare URLs that must be converted to Markdown autolinks or formatted links for cross-parser compatibility; scan the whole document (including the reported lines 60, 80, 104, 123, 141, 147, 164, 169, 175 and any other occurrences) and replace each bare URL with either an autolink using angle brackets (e.g. <https://example.com/>) or a labeled link ([label](https://example.com/)), preserving the original link targets and context.
