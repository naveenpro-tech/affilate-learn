## ‚úÖ FEATURE 1: INVOICE GENERATION SYSTEM

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema
**Migration:** `009_create_invoices_table.py`

```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    invoice_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    payment_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES payments(id),
    invoice_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'package' or 'course'
    item_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    item_description TEXT,
    amount FLOAT NOT NULL,              -- Base amount
    gst_percentage FLOAT DEFAULT 18.0,
    gst_amount FLOAT NOT NULL,
    total_amount FLOAT NOT NULL,
    invoice_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    pdf_url VARCHAR(500),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Invoice Service (`backend/app/services/invoice_service.py`)

**Key Methods:**
- `generate_invoice_number()` - Creates unique invoice numbers (INV-2025-00001)
- `create_invoice(payment_id)` - Creates invoice record and generates PDF
- `generate_pdf(invoice, user, payment)` - Generates professional PDF with ReportLab
- `get_invoice_by_id(invoice_id)` - Retrieves invoice by ID
- `get_invoice_by_payment_id(payment_id)` - Retrieves invoice by payment
- `get_user_invoices(user_id)` - Gets all invoices for a user

**PDF Features:**
- A4 size (595 x 842 points)
- Company header with branding
- Invoice number and date
- User billing details (name, email, phone, complete address)
- Payment information (payment ID, date, method)
- Itemized breakdown with GST calculation
- Professional footer
- Saved to `invoices/` directory

**GST Calculation:**
```python
# Reverse calculation (total includes GST)
gst_percentage = 18.0
base_amount = total_amount / (1 + gst_percentage / 100)
gst_amount = total_amount - base_amount
```

#### API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/invoices.py`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/invoices/generate/{payment_id}` | Generate invoice for payment |
| GET | `/api/invoices/{invoice_id}` | Get invoice by ID |
| GET | `/api/invoices/{invoice_id}/download` | Download invoice PDF |
| GET | `/api/invoices/` | Get all user invoices |
| GET | `/api/invoices/payment/{payment_id}` | Get invoice by payment ID |

**Authentication:** All endpoints require JWT authentication  
**Authorization:** Users can only access their own invoices (admins can access all)
