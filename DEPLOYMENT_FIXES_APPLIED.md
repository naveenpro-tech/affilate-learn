# 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ❌ Backend Error on Render
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'`

**Root Cause**: 
- The `razorpay` package requires `setuptools` (which provides `pkg_resources`)
- `setuptools` was not listed in `requirements.txt`
- Render's Python 3.13 environment doesn't include it by default

**Fix Applied**: ✅
- Added `setuptools>=65.0.0` to `backend/requirements.txt`
- This will be installed during Render deployment

**File Modified**: `backend/requirements.txt`
```diff
# FastAPI and server
fastapi==0.115.6
uvicorn[standard]==0.34.0
python-multipart==0.0.20
+ setuptools>=65.0.0
```

### ❌ Frontend Error on Vercel
**Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-player'`

**Root Cause**:
- The video player page (`app/courses/[id]/topics/[topicId]/page.tsx`) uses `react-player`
- Package was not installed in `package.json`

**Fix Applied**: ✅
- Installed `react-player` package
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

**Command Run**: `npm install react-player`

**Files Modified**: 
- `frontend/package.json`
- `frontend/package-lock.json`

## ✅ Changes Committed and Pushed

**Commit**: `fix: add setuptools to requirements.txt and react-player to frontend dependencies`

**Files Changed**:
1. `backend/requirements.txt` - Added setuptools
2. `frontend/package.json` - Added react-player
3. `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies

**Git Status**: ✅ Pushed to `main` branch

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Backend (Render)
Your backend deployment should now work! Render will:
1. Clone your repository
2. Install all packages from `requirements.txt` (including setuptools)
3. Start the server with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

**Action Required**:
- Go to Render dashboard
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
- Or wait for auto-deploy to trigger

### Frontend (Vercel)
Your frontend deployment should now work! Vercel will:
1. Clone your repository
2. Install all packages from `package.json` (including react-player)
3. Build the Next.js application
4. Deploy to production

**Action Required**:
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
- Or push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Backend Deployment
**Before**: ❌ Failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'`

**After**: ✅ Should deploy successfully with all dependencies installed

**Logs to Watch For**:
```
Successfully installed setuptools-XX.X.X
Successfully installed razorpay-1.4.2
Application startup complete
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX
```

### Frontend Deployment
**Before**: ❌ Failed with `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-player'`

**After**: ✅ Should build successfully with all dependencies

**Logs to Watch For**:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Creating an optimized production build
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Backend Still Fails
1. Check Render logs for new errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL is valid (Neon database not suspended)
4. Check Python version is 3.11+ (not 3.13 if issues persist)

### If Frontend Still Fails
1. Check Vercel build logs for new errors
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly
3. Clear Vercel cache and redeploy
4. Check for TypeScript errors

### If Integration Fails (CORS errors)
1. Update CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`
2. Add your Vercel URL to allowed origins:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://your-app.vercel.app",
        "http://localhost:3000",
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
3. Redeploy backend

## 📊 Summary

### What Was Wrong
1. **Backend**: Missing `setuptools` package (required by razorpay)
2. **Frontend**: Missing `react-player` package (used in video player)

### What Was Fixed
1. **Backend**: Added `setuptools>=65.0.0` to requirements.txt
2. **Frontend**: Installed `react-player` package

### What You Need to Do
1. **Render**: Redeploy backend (it will pick up the new requirements.txt)
2. **Vercel**: Redeploy frontend (it will pick up the new package.json)
3. **Test**: Verify everything works end-to-end

## ✅ Status

- ✅ Backend fix applied and pushed
- ✅ Frontend fix applied and pushed
- ⏳ Waiting for redeployment on Render
- ⏳ Waiting for redeployment on Vercel
- ⏳ Integration testing pending

---

## 🎉 Final Notes

Both deployment errors have been fixed! The issues were simple missing dependencies:
- Backend needed `setuptools` for razorpay
- Frontend needed `react-player` for video playback

**Your application is now ready for production deployment!**

Just redeploy on both platforms and everything should work.
